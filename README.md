# Zer0-Hour-Ultimate-Peak
A configurable mod for Digistruct Peak in Borderlands 2

This mod allows veteran players to challenge themselves at Digistruct Peak.

What this mod does not offer:
* Effeminate or vain things, such as "skins".
* Juvenile attempts to introduce new weapons.
* Juvenile attempts to introduce new Class Mods.
* Fill every chest with legendary loot.

What it does offer:
* Considerably enhanced enemies.
* The ability to configure what enemies appear, and where.
* A few weapon buffs.

Enemies may wield any weapon or shield, including Legendaries and Pearls. Their jumps, dodges and rolls are quicker. Their nades do 2x damage.

Enemies that spawn other enemies, such as Black Queens and Contstructors are configurable.
I have given Saturn a decent loot pool.



This mod makes use of Enemy Enhancer 3.2 by Nocturni over at BLCMods, I believe. I have corrected some errors in this script and otherwise reworked it for use with Ultimate Peak. I do like to give credit where it is due, and I try to - when I can remember who to give credit to and when I can remember what portions of a mod someone else wrote.

But I can't remember all those details and, frankly, it doesn't bother me. At all. These mods are simply scripts. Some are quite imaginitive; some have many hours of work in them. But none of them are groundbreaking works of art deserving of some protection or accreditation. I don't give a rat's hind end what you do with the portions of script that I myself wrote. Take it. Steal it. Take a whiz on it. I don't care. But have fun with it. That's the point.
