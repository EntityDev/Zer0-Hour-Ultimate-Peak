# Zero-Hour-Super-Swap
A collection of enemy swapping scripts for Borderlands 2

Many veteran Borderlands 2 players find the game to be less than challenging. Zero Hour's Super Swap scripts were created to address this problem.

Zero Hour Super Swap scripts are  designed to be tough. The following ideas have been incorporated into their design. For maximum enjoyment and challenge, it is recommended that these balancing rules be enforced by the host:

- Minimum of 3 players
- Each player should have a maxiumum of 35% in any Badass Rank Bonus Stat
- No modified weapons or gear
- No Bee shield
- Explosive launchers only

I care **nothing** about skins, loot, modified weapons or modified characters/skills. I care only about a good fight. Zero Hour Super Swap scripts are all about swapping enemies, and making those enemies challenging. If I knew how to prevent all loot drops, I'd do it. Dropped loot clutters up the place.

All scripts include Enemy Enhancer Extreme v3.1 by theNocturni over at BLCMods. He chose to include buffs to Gaige's Deathtrap and Axton's turrets in his mod. I have removed those sections, as my intent is to challenge the player and his chosen character, as designed by Gearbox.

Enemy Enhancer Extreme 3.1 allows enemies to spawn with blue, purple and legendary weapons, and red text shields.

All Zero Hour Super Swap scripts are configured with options. Many of the swapped enemies and mixes have options for either Super Swap or other interesting combinations. For maximum challenge, select the Super Swap option for each enemy/mix in your Filter Tool before executing the script.

A note about executing scripts:
From the main menu in the game, hit Escape. Answer Yes to be taken to the "Title Screen". Open your console and execute the script. Close the console and hit any key to return to the main menu.
